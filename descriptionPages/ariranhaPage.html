			<p id="ariranhaText">The Giant Otter, a semi-aquatic species found in South America, is the largest otter in the world. With its sleek body and webbed feet, it is perfectly adapted for aquatic life. These social creatures primarily feed on fish and face endangerment due to habitat loss, pollution, and illegal hunting. Conservation efforts aim to protect their habitats and promote sustainable fishing practices to secure their future.</p>
