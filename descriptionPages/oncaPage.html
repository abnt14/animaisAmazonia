			<p id="oncaText">The Onça Pintada, also known as the spotted leopard, is a magnificent feline found primarily in the Americas. With its yellow-orange fur marked by beautiful black rosette-like spots, the Onça Pintada is considered one of the most beautiful species of big cats. It is a powerful predator capable of hunting large prey such as capybaras and deer. Unfortunately, the Onça Pintada faces significant threats, including habitat loss and illegal hunting, which jeopardize its survival. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this emblematic species and preserve its importance in the ecosystems where it resides.</p>
