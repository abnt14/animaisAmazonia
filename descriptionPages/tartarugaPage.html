			<p id="tartarugaText">The Amazon river turtle is the largest freshwater turtle in South America. They nest on the riverbanks, where they lay their eggs. The hatchlings face many challenges to reach the river. Unfortunately, these turtles are threatened due to habitat destruction, illegal trade, and egg consumption. Conservation efforts are being made to protect these turtles and their environment. Preserving the Amazon river turtle is important for the health of the Amazon rainforest ecosystem.</p>
